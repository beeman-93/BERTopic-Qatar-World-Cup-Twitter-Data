2026 World Cup venues selected: Which cities will host in USA, Canada, Mexico   via @NBCSportsSoccer
Have seen the Canada US Mexico hosted World Cup being called CUM 2026 online and I wont be referring to it any other way from this day forth.
For 2026 FIFA World Cup 48 teams will participate Im so much excited 
2026 couldnt come sooner. How odd that World Cup will be. No Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar, Neuer, mueller, Navas, Ochoa, modric, and many more. Had some time to digest it and Im happy either Messi Ronaldo or Neymar got 1. Just sucks to see the other 2 go. BUT #CR7REVENGETOUR IS NOW
Had to head to work at halftime of the final earlier so didnt get to live it out on Twitter too much but man, there will never be anything like the World Cup.2026 is going to be so special.
I will do everything in my absolute power to be present at the World Cup Final in 2026 in 
2026 World cup. I need USA vs England on 4th of July at Boston, Massachusetts please #FIFAWorldCup
Who else is going to the 2026 World Cup 
Gutted World Cup over i hope there in 2026 in Canada, USA, and Mexico.
THE WORLD CUP IS GONNA BE TEN MINS AWAY FROM ME IN 2026

France disappointed but proud of fightback in epic World Cup final  FBCÂ News  
I am beyond saddened. I dont know how much longer I am going to be around to watch France get another chance to win the World Cup. Giroud, Lloris, Griezmann wont be around, most likely, the next time France plays on the world stage. There are not only great players, but
My nephews reaction to France losing the #WorldCup #FIFAWorldCup He goes to a French school  
France fumbling the World Cup reminded me of how you meant the world to me and I let us fumble  I hope youre doing good 
send this to all your french friends on this fine world cup day 
French people not only lost that World Cup but they also have to deal with the consequences of Emily In Paris season 3
France leave World Cup with heads heldÂ high  
France World Cup squad is indicative of where African football can amp is headed - higher
As a basketball fan , I must admit that this save/block from martinez is better than Lebrons block with 1:58 second left in the game 7. If he didnt stopped that, france wins the world cup.

LBJ SUCKSLeBron James faces ridicule for odd timing of World Cup tweet 
Last tweet about this world cup:1 I enjoyed this world cup alot cause none of what i predicted happen2 nothing beat a world cup in Haiti like there this vibe that was missing when Brazil and even today when  won4 Morroco was THE surprise team5 no comment about  win 
the only relevant world cup tweet ever
Wasnt the date of the final already known at this time In other words, this guy predicted that a perennial soccer powerhouse #2 in the world at time of this tweet would win the World Cup. This aint Nostradamus, folks
The game and the world cup are over. Stop running these tweets...
First the World Cup then the Epic Owns. Ive loved Twitter today.
Experience the true Power of Content Marketing.#contentmarketing #twittermarketing #FIFAWorldCup #LionelMessið“ƒµ #WorldCup #socialmediamarketing #MondayMotivation  
The condition of Twitter shouldnt be that bad. The cost of FTEs and contractors is reduced by around 80% yet the site didnt collapse even during the World Cup and Im seeing ads from Apple, Valentino, Versace etc. so companies are still advertising on Twitter.
Over 200k requests for World Cup scores at   over the past month, less than a GB of data transferred.Some websites read: Twitter might be a dumpster fire right now, but I hope @PlainTextSports stands apart as a reliable utility for everyone  
I have never clicked on a World Cup, soccer, or FIFA link in my life.  So, @elonmusk, why is this bullshit in my notifications instead of my feed
